        <p style="font-size: 200%;">The earliest texts referring to the origins of chess date from the beginning of the
            7th century. Three are written in Pahlavi (Middle Persian) and one, the Harshacharita, is in
            Sanskrit. One of these texts, the Chatrang-namak, represents one of the earliest written accounts of
            chess. The narrator Bozorgmehr explains that Chatrang, the Pahlavi word for chess, was introduced to Persia
            by 'Dewasarm, a great ruler of India' during the reign of Khosrow I.

            The oldest known chess manual was in Arabic and dates to about 840, written by al-Adli ar-Rumi (800–870), a
            renowned Arab chess player, titled Kitab ash-shatranj (The Book Of Chess). This is a lost manuscript, but is
            referenced in later works. Here also, al-Adli attributes the origins of Persian chess to India, along
            with the eighth-century collection of fables Kalīla wa-Dimna. By the twentieth century, a substantial
            consensus developed regarding chess's origins in northwest India in the early 7th century.
            More recently, this consensus has been the subject of further scrutiny.</p>
