    <h1>CHESS</h1>
    <p>Chess is a recreational and competitive board game played between two players. It is sometimes called Western or
        international chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi. The current form of the game emerged
        in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from similar, much older games of
        Indian and Persian origin.</p>
    <p>Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people
        worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments.
        <span style="color: red;">Magnus Carlsen is the current world champion of this game.</span></p>
    <p>Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information. It is played on a square chessboard with
        64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid.</p>
